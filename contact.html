  <p>
I’m an illustrator and visual journalist currently based in New York.
I grew up on the sunny side of Southern California, where I first
became interested in visual storytelling and drawing as a way to
make sense of the world.
</p>

<p>
My approach to illustration is shaped by a background in
photojournalism, developed through newsroom editorial work 
across the United States. That experience continues
to inform my emphasis on narrative, character, and observational
detail.
</p>

<p>
My work has appeared in
<em>The Daily Beast</em>,
<em>The New York Post</em>,
and the
<em>New York Daily News</em>.
</p>

<p>
I’m currently a photo editor at
<em>The Daily Beast</em>,
while continuing to focus on illustration for editorial,
entertainment, and political work.
